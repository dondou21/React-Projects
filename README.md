## Router branches
1. Create layout component
2. /**
   * Challenge: set up the code so we can use a layout route!
   * 
   * 1. Create a folder called "components"
   * 2. Create 2 new component files: Layout.jsx and Header.jsx
   * 3. Move the <header> code below to the Header component file. 
   *    (DON'T import that Header component here!)
   */

3. /**
 * Challenge:
 * 1. Add a "Host" link to the Navbar that takes you to the "/host" path
 * 2. Create the following components in the pages/Host folder:
 *    a. Dashboard ("/host")
 *    b. Income ("/host/income")
 *    c. Reviews ("/host/reviews")
 *    These components can just have an h1 for now that says, e.g.
 *    "Host Dashboard here".
 * 3. Set up routes for each of these pages in the Routes below. FOR NOW,
 *    don't worry about nesting anything, you can just put them on the same
 *    level as the "/vans", etc. routes below.

4.  /**
   * Challenge: Make the HostLayout component!
   * The HostLayout should use Links to navigate to the following
   * routes: 
   *    * Dashboard ("/host")
   *    * Income ("/host/income")
   *    * Reviews ("/host/reviews")
   * Then replace the parent "/host" route's element below with the
   * new HostLayout component you made.
   * 
   * NOTE: The dashboard route/page will be gone for now, but don't fret.
   * We'll be fixing that in the next lesson.
